Aloha, if you haven't heard, 'm a Front End Engineer at <a href="https://mamamia.com.au">mamamia.com.au</a>. I'm from Hawaii but currently live in Japan.

I love CSS and would say I probably know it better than any other programming language. In addition to CSS, I do the other front end stuff (HTML, JavaScript, etc...). Currently I'm learning Python.

<h2 class="post-subtitle" style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">Misc things about me</h2>

- I try to meditate daily for 20 minutes (sometimes more, sometimes less)
- My favorite video game is Street Fighter 2
- I like whisky and tequila
- My favorite things to eat are tacos and popcorn.
- I spend most of my day with a french bulldog.
